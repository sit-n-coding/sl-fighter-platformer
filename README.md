# sl-fighter-platformer

**Game Version:** v1.0

**Unity Version:** 2021.3.16f1 LTS

This is a demo/proof of concept of a save & load fighter platformer. It features the basics of 2D Platformer combat, with the player and the enemy AI shooting projectiles at each other, but with the added twist of both players being able to save and load game states simutaneously in the game. This can allow for interesting strategies, such as saving a state where an opponent is cornered, or for saving at a place for safety. Loading into such states can give the player an advantage by surprising the opponent or being able to counter strategies that have taken during that skipped timeframe.

## Controls
* K to save
* L to load
* A, W, D as directional buttons
* Space to shoot

## User Interface
* Green Slider Bar represents your health.
* Red Slider Bar represents the opponents health.
* Orange Slider Bar tells you when your save state is going to expire.
* Blue Slider Bar tells you when you are ready to save another game state.
